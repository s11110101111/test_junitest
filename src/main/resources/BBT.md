1 00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,069
<i>Previously on The Big Bang Theory:</i>

2 00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:07,730 I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and
Koothrappali.

3 00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,842

- For three months?
- Yes.

4 00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,408 What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?

5 00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,977 It means I wish you weren't going,

6 00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,524 Oh, thank God we're home.

7 00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,693 I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell,

8 00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,363 It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.

9 00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,433 I don't know what Arctic expedition you were on...

10 00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,602 ...I thought it was a hoot and a half.

11 00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,844 Oh, hi, Mom.

12 00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,211 No. I told you I'd call you when I got home. I'm not home yet.

13 00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,089 All right. I'm home.

14 00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,188 The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success.

15 00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,024 I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future.

16 00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,099 Actually, I shouldn't say that. I'm entirely certain.

17 00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:14,135 No, Mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my
safety.

18 00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,367 The fact that I'm home safe doesn't prove it worked.

19 00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,410
<i>That logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc.</i>

20 00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,983 No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.

21 00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,952

- I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.
- Mother, I have to go.

22 00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,589 Yeah, love you. Bye.

23 00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,322 Hello, old friend.

24 00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,667 Daddy's home.

25 00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,671 Leonard, you're back.

26 00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,071 Yeah, I just stopped by to say...

27 00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,015

- Yeah, so hi.
- Hi.

28 00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,088 Damn it, I should've gone over and told her we were back.

29 00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,100 Yeah, it was first come, first serve.

30 00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,531 I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings...

31 00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,397

- ...I won't forget your contributions.
- Great.

32 00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,731 I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech.

33 00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,498 When I write my memoirs...

34 00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,702 ...you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed
copy.

35 00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,676

- We have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

36 00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,547 Damn his Vulcan hearing.

37 00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,318 You are planning a party for me, aren't you?

38 00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,920 Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

39 00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,422 If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know...

40 00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,893 ...I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.

41 00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,532 Yeah. We'll keep that in mind. Look, we need to talk to you...

42 00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,537 ...about something that happened at the North Pole.

43 00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,005 If this is about the night the heat went out...

44 00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,736 ...there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

45 00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,449

- It's not about that.
- We agreed to never speak of it again.

46 00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,243 So we slept together naked.

47 00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,190 It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.

48 00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,255

- He's speaking about it.
- For me it was a bonding moment.

49 00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,963 Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks...

50 00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,732 ...we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding
anything...

51 00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,138 ...and you were acting like an obnoxious giant dictator?

52 00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,370 I thought we were gonna be gentle with him.

53 00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,640 That's why I added the "tator."

54 00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,887 And when we finally got our first positive data...

55 00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,318 ...you were so happy.

56 00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:22,554 Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.

57 00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,935 Well, ahem, in actuality, what your equipment detected...

58 00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,938 ...wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles...

59 00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:40,444 ...as it was static from the electric can opener we were turning on
and off.

60 00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,509 He just went colon, capital O.

61 00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,789

- You tampered with my experiment?
- We had to.

62 00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,950 It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian.

63 00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,662 You see that? I added the "ensian."

64 00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,529 Did Leonard know about this?

65 00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,499 Leonard's my best friend. Surely Leonard didn't know.

66 00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,332

- It was his idea.
- Of course it was.

67 00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,633 The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

68 00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,111

- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

69 00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,840

- I couldn't think of anyone else.
- Me neither.

70 00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,379 Except for one night when the heat went out.

71 00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,288 Long story. It's... Don't ask.

72 00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,127 Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

73 00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,829 Do not make a sound.

74 00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,033 Whispering, "Do not make a sound"...

75 00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,063 ...is a sound.

76 00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,903 Damn his Vulcan hearing.

77 00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,704 Not a good time, Sheldon.

78 00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,315 Penny. Penny. Penny.

79 00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,710 Ugh, this is ridiculous.

80 00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,146

- What?
- Hello, Penny.

81 00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,757 I realize you're currently at the mercy of your biological urges...

82 00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,384 ...but as you have a lifetime of poor decisions ahead, may I
interrupt this one?

83 00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,357 Great to see you too. Come on in.

84 00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,493 Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception.

85 00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,398 Do you have anything to say?

86 00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,063 Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself.

87 00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,837 I don't expect you to. I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me with
Penny...

88 00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,277 ...for a session of self-criticism and repentance.

89 00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,846 Can someone tell me what's going on here?

90 00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:32,549 What's going on is I was led to believe I was making strides in
science...

91 00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,887 ...when in fact I was being fed false data...

92 00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,395 ...at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy
toy.

93 00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,129 Is that true?

94 00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,863

- It was the only way to make him happy.
- Why'd you have to make him happy?

95 00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,803 Because when he wasn't happy we wanted to kill him.

96 00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,469 That was even a plan.

97 00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,707 We were going to throw his Kindle outside.

98 00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:00,046 And when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to
death.

99 00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,821

- That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
- No.

100 00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,550 The overreaction was to tie your limbs to four different sled-dog
teams...

101 00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,751 ...and yell, "Mush!"

102 00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,657 Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual
results.

103 00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,598 Yes,, but the actual results are unsuccessful.

104 00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,467 I sent an e-mail to everyone at the university...

105 00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,301 ...explaining I confirmed string theory...

106 00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,909 ...and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.

107 00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,478 Oh. See, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that.

108 00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,279 So write another e-mail. Set the record straight. It's no big
deal.

109 00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,348 You're right, Leonard. That's not a big deal.

110 00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,152 All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream...

111 00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,922 ...and humiliate me in front of the whole university.

112 00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,098 That, FYI, was sarcasm.

113 00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,166 I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.

114 00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,768

- Oh. That poor thing.
- Yeah, I feel terrible.

115 00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,969 Wait. Aren't you gonna go talk to him?

116 00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,206 Well, I... He'll be fine. The guy's a trouper. Come here.

117 00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:07,217 No, no, you're right. You shouldn't talk to him. I will.

118 00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,450 Man, I cannot catch a break.

119 00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,163

- Hey. Do you wanna talk?
- About what?

120 00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,167 Being betrayed by my friends?

121 00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,569 Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?

122 00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,637 And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con.

123 00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,143 Oh, hon...

124 00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,523
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

125 00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,184 That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.

126 00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,853 Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know your sad song.

127 00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,865 I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.

128 00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,928 Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.

129 00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,700 Really? Did you have the Nobel Prize in waitressing...

130 00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,673 ...stolen from you?

131 00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,912 Well, no.

132 00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,844 But, uh, when I was in high school, one of my friends heard...

133 00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,110 ...I was gonna be named head cheerleader. I was so excited.

134 00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,221 My mom even made me a celebration pie.

135 00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,187 Then they named stupid Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.

136 00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,452 Big old slutbag.

137 00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,096 Are you saying that you think a celebration pie...

138 00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,565 ...is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?

139 00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,603 Well, they're pretty tasty.

140 00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,108 And on a different but not unrelated topic...

141 00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,041 ...based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits...

142 00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:45,412 ...do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer
leader?

143 00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,618 Look, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard...

144 00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,057 ...really meant to hurt you. They just told an unfortunate lie...

145 00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,824 ...to deal with a difficult situation. You know what it's like?

146 00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,230
<i>Remember the new Star Trek movie? Kirk has to take over the ship...</i>

147 00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,633 ...so he tells Spock stuff he knew wasn't true.

148 00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,002 Like saying Spock didn't care his mom died.

149 00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,603
<i>I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie?</i>

150 00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,417

- I like the new look.
- Thanks.

151 00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,184 I call it the Clooney.

152 00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,354 I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever.

153 00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,962 Hey, how's Sheldon doing?

154 00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,828 He came out of his room wearing his Darth Vader helmet...

155 00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,938 ...and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I'd say a
little better.

156 00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,042 If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny
finally...? You know.

157 00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,438

- Howard.
- I don't care...

158 00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,172 ...but my genitals wanted me to ask.

159 00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,844 Tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.

160 00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,518 He says they didn't do it.

161 00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,787 Sheldon, over here.

162 00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,401 What are you doing?

163 00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,841 Well, I feel bad for the guy.

164 00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,738 Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?

165 00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,474 Because I am without friends.

166 00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:28,143 Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone.

167 00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,016 Even while seated.

168 00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,919 Come on. We said we were sorry.

169 00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,184 It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry"...

170 00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,421 ...and an apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done
to me.

171 00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,066 Hey, Cooper. Read your retraction e-mail.

172 00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,600 Way to destroy your reputation.

173 00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,098 You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.

174 00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,832 It's not true.

175 00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,001 People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.

176 00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,773 All right, I've had enough. Attention, everyone.

177 00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,610 I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

178 00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,082 As many of you in the Physics Department know...

179 00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,847 ...my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.

180 00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,717 Off a cliff.

181 00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,292

- My credibility may have been damaged.
- Completely wrecked.

182 00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:14,229 But I would like to remind you that in science there's no such
thing as failure.

183 00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,958 There once was a man...

184 00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,127 ...who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant...

185 00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,569 ...as the single biggest blunder of his career.

186 00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,973 That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.

187 00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,144 Yeah, but research into dark energy proved...

188 00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,444 ...Einstein's cosmological constant was actually right all along.

189 00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,250 So you're still, surprise, surprise, a loser.

190 00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,083 Oh, you think you're so clever.

191 00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,629 Well, let me just tell you. While I do not currently have a
retort...

192 00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,767 ...check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.

193 00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,997 So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

194 00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,838 Well, we'll always have the night the heat went out.

195 00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,579

- Hi.
- Hey.

196 00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:13,487 Since we got interrupted last night, I didn't have a chance to
give you this.

197 00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,089 Aw, Leonard. You shouldn't have.

198 00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,828 Oh, boy. Ha, ha.

199 00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,134 What is it?

200 00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,503 It's a snowflake from the North Pole.

201 00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,834

- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

202 00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,844 It'll last forever. I preserved it in a 1-percent solution of
polyvinyl acetal resin.

203 00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,611 God, that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me...

204 00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,154 ...that I didn't understand.

205 00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,224 It's actually a pretty simple process.

206 00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,987 You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers, which polymerize...

207 00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,463 Red alert. Leonard, Sheldon ran away.

208 00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,229 Man, I cannot catch a break.

209 00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,367 So how do you know he ran away?

210 00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,499 I mean, he's not answering his phone, he handed in his
resignation...

211 00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,703 ...and he sent me a text that said,
"I'm running away."

212 00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,575 Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

213 00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,013 Well... Leonard. Aren't you gonna do something?

214 00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,043 Well, of course I'm gonna do something.

215 00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,416 Uh, Howard, check the comic-book store.

216 00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,424 Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I'll stay with Penny in her
apartment.

217 00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,694 Oh, damn it.

218 00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,354 It's Sheldon's mother.

219 00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,057 A break cannot be caught.

220 00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,668 Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

221 00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,528 He is?

222 00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,037 Sheldon went home to Texas.

223 00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,832 Yeah... No, I know he resigned.

224 00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,844 Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault.

225 00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,077 No, no. You're right. Someone needs to come talk to him.

226 00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,687 Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah. All right.

227 00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,247 New plan.

228 00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,383 Howard, you and Raj go to Texas, I'll stay with Penny in her
apartment.

229 00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,296

- You're not gonna go with them?
- Well, you know...

230 00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,262 ...I gave you the snowflake, and we were kissing, and...

231 00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,527 Come on. I don't wanna go to Texas.

232 00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:09,064 Oh, right. And I do? My people already crossed the desert once.
We're done.

233 00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,972 Trust me, you'll be fine. See you.

234 00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,278 Well, wait a second, Leonard. Come on. How can you not go?

235 00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,941

- He's your best friend.
- But I already saw him naked.

236 00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,882

- Just come here.
- No.

237 00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,249 I promise I will be here when you get back.

238 00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,051 Just go help Sheldon.

239 00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,055

- Really?
- Yeah.

240 00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,594 We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.

241 00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,398 Maybe you can.

242 00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,067 Go.

243 00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,338 Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?

244 00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,282

- Here you go, Shelly.
- Thanks, Mom.

245 00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,316 Yeah.

246 00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,987 Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.

247 00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,181 Oh, Mom.

248 00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,850 This is not California, land of the heathen.

249 00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,320 Give me.

250 00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,365 By his hand we are all...

251 00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,629 Fed.

252 00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,264

- Give us, Lord, our daily...
- Bread.

253 00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,707

- Please know that we are truly...
- Grateful.

254 00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,370

- For every cup and every...
- Plateful.

255 00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,448 Amen.

256 00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,951 Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

257 00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,789 My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.

258 00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,622 Whatever. Jesus still loves you.

259 00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,694 Thank you for carving a smiley face in my sandwich.

260 00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,530 I know how to take care of my baby.

261 00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:49,038 His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's
Chinese.

262 00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,712 So do you want to talk about what happened...

263 00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,816 ...with you and your little friends?

264 00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,717

- They're not my friends.
- All right.

265 00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,485 If you recall, when you were little we sat right here at this very
spot...

266 00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,528 ...and talked about the problems you had getting along with the
neighbor kids.

267 00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,689 That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence...

268 00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,859 ...and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.

269 00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,069 Oh, baby, they knew very well why they hated you.

270 00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,750 I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.

271 00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,450 Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck.

272 00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,289 Plus it was the only boys' large they had.

273 00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,964 I'm sorry. This does not look like Texas. Where's the tumbleweeds?

274 00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,265

- Where's the saloons?
- Saloons?

275 00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,271 Like in the movies I saw growing up.

276 00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,240
<i>You know, uh, 4 for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.</i>

277 00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,974
<i>This neighborhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

278 00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,411 I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.

279 00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,951 What can I tell you?

280 00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,749 They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over
there.

281 00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,234 Will you please take that stupid hat off?

282 00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,892 No, I wanna blend in.

283 00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,004
<i>To what? Toy Story?</i>

284 00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,733 Hi, boys.

285 00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,109

- Howdy, ma'am.
- Howdy to you too. You got here quick.

286 00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,909

- We took the redeye.
- Come on in.

287 00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,574 Thank you kindly.

288 00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,516

- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.

289 00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,988 If y'all don't mind, I got a hankering for a Lone Star Beer.

290 00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,761 There's no alcohol in this household, stop talking like that and
lose the hat.

291 00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,967 Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-hoo if you have it.

292 00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,795 You'll take a cola.

293 00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,300 What about you? Raj, is it?

294 00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,609 Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Ha-ha-ha.

295 00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,440 Because, you know, at our church...

296 00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,639 ...we have a woman who's an amazing healer.

297 00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,614 Mostly she does crutch and wheelchair people...

298 00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,050 ...but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot...

299 00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,521 ...at whatever Third-World demon is running around inside of you.

300 00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,157 If you don't mind, there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles...

301 00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,959 ...and you have no idea how much I wanna be on it.

302 00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,966

- A girl?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

303 00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,469 Oh, good. I've been praying for you.

304 00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,737 Oh, Sheldon.

305 00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,173 What are they doing here?

306 00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,836

- We came to apologize.
- Again.

307 00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,142 And bring you home. Pack up your stuff and we'll head back.

308 00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,711 No. This is my home now.

309 00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:53,086 Thanks to you, my career is over. I will spend the rest of my life
here...

310 00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,524 ...trying to teach evolution to creationists.

311 00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,060 You watch your mouth, Shelly.

312 00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,999 Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

313 00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,661 Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.

314 00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,240 And that is your opinion.

315 00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,178 I forgive you, let's go home.

316 00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,513 Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.

317 00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,127 How about that? Finally caught a break.

318 00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,630 Uh-huh.

319 00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,800 You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?

320 00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,567 Sure.

321 00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,776

- Why does it have to get weird?
- Pbbt. I don't know.

322 00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:54,886 I mean, we were friends and now we're more than friends.

323 00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,957 And we're whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean...

324 00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,423 It is what it is and...

325 00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,618

- Leonard?
- Yeah?

326 00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,888

- It's weird.
- Totally.
